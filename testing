hello fuffy, if you get this please modify it
~I will kill you if you use this name again
Then run the following in your terminal (assuming you have git installed)
~I do now
git add testing
~how about add testing!
git commit -m "right back at ya"
~it's coming
git push
~thats what she said

just so we can test if your key works
~it will if you don't fuck up on your end


Also, your ssh key BETTER be password protected...
~yep I used god, best password ever -_-
