Qoute bot:
accepts:
  $botname last $num quotes for $name --- will provide last $num qoutes for the person who is under $name
  $botname all qoutes for $name --- provide all qoutes for the user (I'm unsure on this because someone could get a huge amount
  $botname quotes $num to $num for $name --- provide all qoutes within this num id and this num2 id, will have some max limit
  $botname qoute $num for $name --- provide num qoute for name
  $botname random qoutes/quote for $name --- provide a random qoute or up to 5 random qoutes for a user, all unique

notes:
try not to break on bad commands :)

Scorebot:
accepts:
  $name +$num --- accepts some num amount and adds that to the $name users score
  score for $name --- return the score for user $name
  $botname dispute --- will cause the bot to go into dispute mode where users can vote to give or deny points (perhaps abstain?)
  $botname modify $name $score --- modify some users score by given num (don't know about this unless I can be sure the user is the admin)
   perhaps we can do this through a private message to the user asking them for some password (doesn't matter to much about security as 
   its only a qoute bot)

notes:
should be some limits on acceptable scores although the dispute function will help moderate it along with admin action
should never be able to give points to yourself, perhaps when it gives the scores it will have some witty lines <_< for
high scorers, probably low scorers as well >_>


General:
Add a special function
whenever someone says "this"
bot replys 
"is"
"MADNESS"
/me kicks $name into pit
